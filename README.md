# 🏨 Hotel Contact AJAX

A simple hotel listing webpage with dynamic contact information loading using JavaScript (AJAX) and PHP.

When users click on the "Contact us" buttons, contact information for each hotel is fetched and displayed using an asynchronous request — without reloading the page.


## 📌 Features

- 🛎️ Displays 3 demo hotels: London, Athens, Paris
- ⚡ AJAX functionality (XMLHttpRequest) to load contact info
- 💬 PHP backend returns different responses based on hotel selection
- 🎨 Background image + basic styling

  ## 🖥️ How to Run

Since this project includes PHP, you need a **local server** to run it.

Option : Using XAMPP/WAMP/Laragon (recommended)

1. Place the project folder inside `htdocs` (for XAMPP)
2. Start Apache from your control panel
3. Open browser and go to:  
   `http://localhost/your-folder-name/hotels.html`

## ⚠️ Note

This project **does not work on GitHub Pages**, because PHP is not supported.  
Use a local server (or deploy to a PHP hosting provider) to test it properly.
